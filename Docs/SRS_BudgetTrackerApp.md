### 1.5 Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the FINTECH Budget Tracker App's requirements. It includes sections on the product's overall description, specific requirements, and any assumptions or constraints that might impact development.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The FINTECH Budget Tracker App is an independent, mobile-based application that will help users track their spending and manage budgets. It will interact with external APIs for currency conversion and may integrate with cloud services for data storage. The app will be user-friendly, targeting individuals who need an easy way to manage their personal finances.

### 2.2 Product Functions

The app will include the following core functions:

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login functionality.
- **Budget Allocation**: Users can create and manage budget categories and allocate specific amounts to each category.
- **Expense Tracking**: Users can manually enter expenses, which will update the remaining budget in real-time.
- **Reports and Visualizations**: The app will generate visual reports showing spending patterns across different categories.
- **Notifications**: Users will receive alerts when they are close to or exceed their budget limits.
- **Data Export**: Users can export their spending data in CSV or PDF format for offline review.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

The primary users are individuals who want to manage their finances effectively. The app should be intuitive and accessible to users of all technical backgrounds. Most users are expected to have basic knowledge of mobile applications.
